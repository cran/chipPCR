Changes from Version 0.0.6 to 0.0.7 [June 26 2014]
* From S3 to S4
* Dependency to qpcR and MBmca packages removed
* New "Depends"/"Imports" to/from MASS, ptw, quantreg and shiny, methods
* Many bug fixes

* Code optimized for speed and less memory usage
* Improved some examples
* New function MFIaggr and class refMFI
* New function effcalc
* amptester 
    - flexible head and tail now
    - nonlinearity test to detect positive amplifications
    - t.test exchanged by wilcox.test to compare levels of head and tail 
      region
    - tests for noise (based on Shapiro-Wilk test) and linearity
* smoother
    - Support for weighted Whittaker smoother
    - Argument "spline" as parameter for internal fixNA detracted
    - Uses splines in fixNA exclusively

    - new regression methods (rank-based estimation models, quantile 
      regression)
    - argument "minmax" detracted and substituted by more powerful
      method "norm"

* NOTE: new naming convention in inder
* bg.max
      - uses inder method by default now
      - better tests for estimated start and end of exponential 
	amplification region
