[March 2021]
The development of the chipPCR package began more than 8 years ago. In 2015, 
chipPCR was published in Bioinformatics. There are sometimes users who give 
feedback to the package. Up to a few bugs there were no hints for new features. 
Recently the package was removed from CRAN. We used the time to make some beauty 
repairs and to adjust the package to 2021. It appears that the package is 
feature complete and used by peers in reviewed publications. Therefore we change 
to version 1.0+.
