\title{
Highly Replicate Number Amplification Curves
}
\description{
Highly replicate number amplification curves with an approximate amplification 
efficiency of 62.5 percent at cycle number 18. The data were derived from a 
simulation such as the AmpSim function.
}
\usage{data(Eff625)}
\format{
  A data frame with 40 (Cycles) observations on the following 1000 
  (amplification curves) variables. The columns are all replicates.
