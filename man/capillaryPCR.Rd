\details{
Modified version of the capillary convective tube isothermal heater heater by 
Chou et al. 2011. As heating system a conventional block heat was used. On the 
top of the heating block, we placed for the uptake of the capillaries an 
aluminum block (8 mm height) in which four holes (3.2 mm diameter and 3.0 mm 
depth with round shaped bottom) were drilled. The capillaries are regular 100 
micro L Roche LightCycler(R). These glass capillaries have a round shaped 
closed bottom (2.3 mm inner diameter and 3.2 mm outer diameter). An "ESE-Log" 
detector (QIAGEN Lake Constance) was used for the real time fluorescent 
measurements, which was mounted in a distance of 5-10 mm next to the 
capillary. The PCR was performed with SYBR(R) Green fluorescent intercalating 
dye. Thereof the ESE-Log has in one channel the excitation at 470 nm and the 
detection at 520 nm. The data was recorded by the FL Digital Software (QIAGEN 
Lake Constance) and the exported text based raw data.
