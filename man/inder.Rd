\title{
Interpolate derivatives
}
\description{
A function for interpolating first and second derivatives using the five-point stencil.
}
\usage{
inder(x, y, Nip = 4)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
is a vector of independent variable.
}

  \item{y}{
is a vector of dependent variable.
}
  \item{Nip}{
is a value which defines how often an interpolation takes place at n equally spaced points 
spanning the interval (default 4). \code{Nip} is a such a resolution. A high \code{Nip} may
improve the precision. \code{Nip}s less than 2 and higher than 20 are not meaningful.
}

}
\details{
The function y = f(x) is numerically derived by five-point stencil. This method do not require any 
assumptions regarding the function f. The function \code{inder} calculates the approximate second 
derivative maximum (SDM) which is commonly used to quantify quantitative real-time PCR experiments.
The SDM might also be useful for isothermal amplification processes. The SDM is calculated from 
a derived cubic spline. Similarly the first approximate approximate derivative maximum (FDM),
second derivative minimum (SDm), and approximate second derivative center (SDC, geometric mean of 
SDM and SDm) are available. FDM, SDm and SDC values can be used to further characterize the 
amplification process.
}
\value{
A list of four elements. The element named \code{x} contains smoothed independent variable. 
The element named \code{y} contains smoothed dependent variable. 
The element named \code{1st_der} contains values of the first derivative. 
The element named \code{2nd_der} contains values of the second first derivative. The element 
named \code{SDM} contains approximate second derivative maximum, \code{SDm} contains approximate 
second derivative minimum, and \code{SDC} contains approximate second derivative center.
